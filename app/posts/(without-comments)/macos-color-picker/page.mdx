Sometimes, less is more. Choosing a hex color should be simple—no extra apps or plugins required. How?

While browsing the web for interesting repositories and developers, I came across [Shu Ding's projects](https://shud.in/projects). That led me to [Paco Coursey's website](https://paco.me/), where I was impressed by how effortlessly one can create an application to use the macOS native color picker.

Here’s how:

1. Open _Script Editor_ and create a new document.
2. Type `choose color`.

3. Save it as an Application in the File Format menu.

4. Now, access it using Spotlight—or a similar tool—to quickly copy the hex code from the second tab with RGB Sliders.

5. Press `Esc` to close the app when you're done.

And that's it! As Paco Coursey put it: _no installation necessary, the colors are always accurate, and you can even save a few favorites to the grid at the bottom_.
