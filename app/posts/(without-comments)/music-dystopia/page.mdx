Throughout the years, I convinced myself that my favourite expression of art is music, without any doubt. Nobody knows the first song we ever listen to, but we might agree that music is an intrinsic part of our everyday. I get used to listening to music when I drive, when I craft code or, among other moments, when I'm relaxed and with a beer in my hand. I play also acoustic guitar since December 2015 with [FATUM](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7w0DQsi7NPnksUEo0mpGro?si=qwaRn-8QT0S99sKg_QON-g).

Music is the art, among the others, that we mainly appreciate through the ears (I should not disconsider the ones who feel the music through the vibrations) and also the one that can be integrated into other expressions of art, like cinema.

As we know, only in recent years — and due to the tremendous speed of evolution of technology — have we been able to transform music into a ubiquitous art: we can use to listen to it everywhere, anywhere with a small gadget. But that was not possible — at least as straightforward as today — a few decades ago.

But now, let's imagine the following dystopia: we can **only choose ten (10) songs** that we can listen to for the rest of our lives. I think this is a good one to practice and reflect on the most loved and impactful songs we have ever listened to.

So, I'll try to compile the list of 10 songs that I would carry to listen to with me, assuming the dystopic scenario referred to above:

1. [Estranged](https://open.spotify.com/track/3s03nrUInN3NAVjQtmnS0O?si=6628086740bb44d1), _Guns n' Roses_
2. [Echoes](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Mzm1CNqVxtwbCYhOo843s?si=c298df65e43d451b), _Pink Floyd_
3. [Little Wing](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Eolhana7nKHYpcYpdVcT5?si=ef5f099d4f604366), _Jimmy Hendrix_
4. [Wet Sand](https://open.spotify.com/track/3L2Nyi3T7XabH8EEZFLDdX?si=11e40168c5444ff6), _Red Hot Chili Peppers_
5. [Time](https://open.spotify.com/track/4xHWH1jwV5j4mBYRhxPbwZ?si=06e2585934cf421e), _Pink Floyd_
6. [Esse Olhar Que Era Só Teu](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yVfyUXiFntXBFVHcTXdax?si=64343533e52b4a51), _Dead Combo_
7. [Build by Nations](https://open.spotify.com/track/3qaRqV7dTbQV2VVMhd0ejd?si=7a9a782a26d64915), _Greta Van Fleet_
8. [Starway to Heaven](https://open.spotify.com/track/5CQ30WqJwcep0pYcV4AMNc?si=8e8baff07de74c2b), _Led Zeppelin_
9. [Passou Por Mim e Sorriu](https://open.spotify.com/track/0KO8RQJzfq7pULJaOGXfwr?si=5742d824bab343f4), _Deolinda_
10. [Money Trees](https://open.spotify.com/track/74tLlkN3rgVzRqQJgPfink?si=79392c955b50433a), _Kendrick Lamar_

So hard to make this list that I can't even sort it... All of these songs already caused me goosebumps many times. I tried to compile as many artists as possible (except for Pink Floyd ❤️) with as many musical styles as possible. You can find my full playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0LlWarC3mP8Ekcls8lCUde?si=0e684650c5d54325).

It was a good exercise. Time to share yours!
