## What is a shell script?

A shell script is a text file that contains a series of commands. This means that any work you can do on the command line can be automated by a shell script.

Every shell script file has the extension `*.sh`, and you can create it using an editor text - _nano_ or _vim_, for example (or if you want to keep it simple at first, simply use _VS Code_ or other application).

## First steps

Imagine that you want to create the first shell scripting file. Making sure you have _nano_ installed, let's run the following command to start editing the file -> `nano day1.sh`:

```shell filename="day1.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
echo "The first steps into shell scripting"
```

**Note:** you will want to start each shell script with a shebang (`#!`) followed up by the path to an interpreter (`/bin/bash`), that is what determines what program executes the commands listed in the file. Otherwise, the script will be eexecutedusing the current shell.

After saving it, run `chmod +x day1.sh` to make sure you have permission to execute the program.

Then, simply run `./day1.sh` and you'll get in the console the phrase above! Right, you just executed a script :)

Let's dive into more details, starting with simple commands.

## Simple commands

| **Type**                 | **Description**                     | **Notes**                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cat <file>`             | Short for concatenate               | By default it displays the contents of files to the terminal |
| `chmod <options> <file>` | Short for change mode               | You can change the file permissions using this command       |
| `cd <path>`              | Short for change directory          | Used to navigate throughout your directory                   |
| `pwd`                    | Short for present working directory | Get the present working directory's path                     |
| `type <command>`         | Get shell built-in command          | Indicates if the given command is a shell built-in or not    |
| `echo <string>`          | Print in the console what you wrote | Can be seen as the `console.log('')` of shell                |
| `su`                     | Short for superuser                 | Changes the current account to the system root account       |
| `sudo`                   | Short for superuser do              | Executes an action as the system root account                |

## Using variables

Let's now start creating a second file to start mmanipulatingwith variables, running this command -> `nano day2.sh` :

```shell filename="day2.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
SKILL="shell scripting"
echo "I'm getting better at ${SKILL}! Yeahhh!"
```

After running it, you'll check that the variable has been replaced by the text, getting the following message:

```
"I'm getting better at shell scripting! Yeahhh!"
```

Very simple, right? Note that you don't need to specify its type, you simply need to assign the value to the variable. It's very important to know that there are **no spaces around the equal sign**, otherwise, you'll get an error.

### Variable considerations

- Variable names can contain letters, digits and underscores. However, variables can only start with letters or underscores.

  - Example of valid variables:
    - `SKILL`
    - `SKILL5`
    - `_SKILL`
  - Example of invalid variables:

    - `1SKILL`
    - `A-SKILL`
    - `E@VAR`

- By convention, and since they are case sensitive, variable names are in UPPERCASE. However, they can be also written in lowercase, camelCase, PascalCase or snake_case, **but not** in kebab-case.

- To reassign the value of a variable, just write it again with the desired value:
  ```shell showLineNumbers
  #!/bin/bash
  SKILL="shell scripting"
  echo "I'm getting better at ${SKILL}! Yeahhh!"
  SKILL="variable reassignment"
  echo "I'm getting better at ${SKILL}! Yeahhh!"
  ```

## Adding comments

To write a comment in a shell scripting file, just write a `#` with the desired comment. When executed, the script will ignore this line of code -the shebang is the only exception.

```shell showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# The following line will print a string
echo "Just print this line!"
```

Don't forget to use blank lines to improve code readability.

## Writing simple scripts

Imagine you want a script that prints some information about the system. That's what we'll do in the following script. Also, you'll learn some more commands.

```shell showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# This script displays information about the system on which it is executed.

# Tell the user the script is starting.
echo "Starting the script file."

# Display the hostname of the system.
hostname

# Display the current date and time when this information was collected.
date

# Display the kernel release followed by the architecture
uname -r
uname -m

# Display the disk usage in a human-readable format.
df -h

# End the script by letting the user know that it's done.
echo "End of the script file."
```

## `IF` statement

Let's learn how to execute an `if` statement in a script file. This one will output if you are the root user or not. Let's call it `is-root-user.sh`.

```shell filename="is-root-user.sh" showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash

# Determine if the user executing this script is the root user or not.

# Display the UID
echo "Your UID is ${UID}."

# Display if the user is the root user or not.
# Zero indicates that the user is rooted in UNIX systems.
# Spaces in if statements are important!
if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0 ]]
then
  echo "You are root."
else
  echo "You are not root."
fi

```

And that's it! Hope you enjoy it!
