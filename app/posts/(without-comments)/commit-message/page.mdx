A typical git commit message will look like this:

```cmd
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

The type, the scope and the subject should always be written in lowercase and have no more than 70 chars. But what
we should write about each of them?

## Types

It should be adopted one of the following types in a commit message:

| **Type**   | **Description**                                                                                | **Notes**                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                                                                  | new feature for the user, not a new feature for the build script                                     |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                                                      | bugfix for the user, not a fix to a build script                                                     |
| `docs`     | Documentation related changes                                                                  | changes to the documentation                                                                         |
| `style`    | A code that is related to styling that not affects the meaning of the code                     | white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.                                                    |
| `refactor` | A code that neither fix bug nor adds a feature                                                 | refactoring production code; when there are semantic changes; e.g. renaming a variable/function name |
| `perf`     | A code that improves performance                                                               | e.g. refactoring a function or a component                                                           |
| `test`     | Adding new test or making changes to existing test(s)                                          | adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change                                   |
| `chore`    | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation | updating grunt tasks etc.; no production code change                                                 |

## Scope

The scope should always be chosen according to the following criteria:

- should be a generalist and simple, being always composed by only one word
- in case of being a code change that affects all the project, `global` should be the scope
- do not use the name of created files or the added feature.

## Subject

- describe briefly what you did in that commit
- use imperative, present tense (eg: use "add" instead of "added" or "adds")
- don't use dot(.) at the end
- don't capitalize the first letter

There are many tools that I used to write this article, like [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/).

If you have any suggestions, please get in touch :)
