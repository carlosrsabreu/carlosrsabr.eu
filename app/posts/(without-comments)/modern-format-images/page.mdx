_**Disclaimer**: I hope you find this article boring and that you already convert images to `.avif` and `.webp` format without using online converters. Anyway, I'm leaving this blog post here :\)_

If you're building for the web and still converting images using random online converters, then you're not doing it in the most efficient way. Modern image formats like `.avif` and `.webp` can drastically reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality, and they’re supported on most browsers.

The real problem? Converting to them shouldn’t be annoying. Yet most tools make it exactly that.

---

## Why `.avif` should be your default format

`.avif` is the most efficient image format currently available for the web. Compared to `.jpeg` or even `.webp`, it produces smaller files at better quality. It's ideal for websites aiming for performance without visual compromises.

### Advantages of `.avif`:

- **Smaller file sizes** (even compared to `.webp`)
- **Better image quality**, especially at lower bitrates
- **Transparency support** (like `.png`)
- **HDR and 10-bit color support**
- **Modern browser compatibility** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera)

Mozilla summarizes all the pros here[^1]. The main downside? **Encoding is slower** than `.webp` or `.jpeg` and support is not yet comprehensive (and has little historical depth) you should provide a fallback (which I recommend `.webp`). But for most web workflows, that’s not a dealbreaker — it’s a one-time step.

## Use `.webp` as a fallback

Not all browsers support `.avif` yet and that’s where `.webp` comes in. It still offers great compression, loads fast, and is much better than traditional formats like `.jpeg` or `.png` (~30% smaller or more, depending on the image) [^2].

In practice, you should serve both:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="example image" />
</picture>
```

This way, browsers that support `.avif` will use it. Those that don’t will fall back to `.webp` , and if needed, to `.jpeg` as a last resort.

## Please: STOP using online converters

Let’s be honest: online image converters are a pain.

- Sketchy UI full of ads;
- Manual upload/download loops;
- Little to no control over quality settings;
- Risk of uploading sensitive assets to unknown servers.

If you have more than one or two images to process, this quickly becomes a nightmare.

## Convert images locally (without losing time)

To save time and gain full control over image quality and automation, use command-line tools like `cwebp` (for `.webp`) and `avifenc` (for `.avif`).

### Step 1: Install `cwebp` and `libavif` with Homebrew

```bash
brew install webp
brew install libavif
```

### Step 2: Convert a single image

If you want to convert to `.webp` format, using the `cwebp` library:

```bash
cwebp -q 75 image.png -o output.webp
```

Or, if you want to convert to `.avif` format, using the `libavif` library:

```bash
avifenc -q 75 image.png output.avif
```

- The `-q` flag controls quality (0 to 100).
- The higher the number, the better the quality (and larger the file).
- Play with the number to find your ideal balance.

### Step 3: Batch convert a whole folder

Here’s a simple shell script you can add to any project to batch-convert images:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p output

for file in ./*.{png,jpg,jpeg}; do
  filename=$(basename "$file")
  avifenc -q 75 "$file" "output/${filename%.*}.avif"
  cwebp -q 75 "$file" -o "output/${filename%.*}.webp"
done
```

This script will:

- Convert all `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` files in the current directory
- Output both `.avif` and `.webp` versions, with a quality setting of 75
- Store everything in an `output/` folder

You can plug this into your build process or run it manually before deploying new assets.

### In summary

- Use **`.avif`** for best performance.
- Fallback to **`.webp`** for older browsers.
- Avoid online converters and batch your conversions locally.
- Automate wherever possible; it's easy and way more efficient

With `libavif` and `cwebp`, you take full control of your image conversion process. It's fast, offline, and works beautifully for both single images and full folders.

If you’ve been putting off using `.avif` and `.webp` because of the conversion hassle — now you have no excuse. Your images (and your website visitors) will thank you.
