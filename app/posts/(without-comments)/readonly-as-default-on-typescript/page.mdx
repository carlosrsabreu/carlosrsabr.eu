In TypeScript, the `Readonly` utility type can quietly save you from hard-to-diagnose bugs. Let's understand how:

For demonstration purposes, let's suppose we have a shared `User` object across multiple modules:

```ts
type User = {
  name: string
  age: number
}

const user: User = {
  name: 'Carlos',
  age: 18
}
```

At some point, a developer unknowingly modified the user name when developing a new screen and didn't notice it:

```ts
user.name = 'Roberto' // we get no error
```

This change led to unexpected behavior in parts of the app relying on the original value. And things like this can be avoided using `Readonly` utility type:

```ts
type User = Readonly<{
  name: string
  age: number
}>

const user: User = {
  name: 'Carlos',
  age: 18
}

user.name = 'Roberto' // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
```

With `Readonly`, the compiler stopped us from making accidental mutations. This simple change makes the `User` type safe by design. When data is meant to stay constant, let the compiler protect it.
